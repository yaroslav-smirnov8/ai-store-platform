I learned to generate images and videos, create dialogues and voice them with AI, develop games and whatnot! 🙂 Really liked that the intensive includes two forms of instructions - video and text. Especially impressed by the number of AI tools that Yaroslav tested and selected for the intensive. According to Yaroslav, this intensive is an extract from a more voluminous course. But even this information was more than enough for me 👀 Everything was at the highest level! Once again huge thanks, wish you further success! 🎈",
